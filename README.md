#ABSTRACT#
This project focuses on developing an automated web scraping and email notification system using UiPath. The workflow accepts user input, extracts relevant information from web search results based on the input topic, and sends the compiled data to a specified email address. The automation integrates UI automation, data extraction, and email dispatching, demonstrating the practical application of Robotic Process Automation in streamlining repetitive tasks. The system was designed to improve efficiency by reducing manual effort and ensuring the timely delivery of information. It utilizes UiPathâ€™s built-in activities for browser navigation, data scraping, Excel operations, and email communication. This project not only showcases the power of RPA tools in automating day-to-day tasks but also highlights the potential of integrating intelligent automation in real-world business scenarios. The internship provided a strong foundation in UiPath Studio and its capabilities, offering valuable insights into process design and workflow optimization. Overall, the project reflects a meaningful application of automation in enhancing productivity and accuracy.
